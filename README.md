# NAND Gate Simulation Project

This project implements a simulation of digital logic gates, with a focus on the NAND gate and its applications. The goal is to demonstrate the functionality of different logic gates.

## Key Classes

- **Gate.java**: Abstract class representing a generic logic gate.
- **NANDGate.java**: Implementation of the NAND gate.
- **ANDGate.java**: Implementation of the AND gate.
- **ORGate.java**: Implementation of the OR gate.
- **NORGate.java**: Implementation of the NOR gate.
- **XORGate.java**: Implementation of the XOR gate.

## Testing

- **NANDGateTest.java**: Unit tests for the NAND gate.
- **ANDGateTest.java**: Unit tests for the AND gate.
- **ORGateTest.java**: Unit tests for the OR gate.
- **NORGateTest.java**: Unit tests for the NOR gate.
- **XORGateTest.java**: Unit tests for the XOR gate.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/furkanansn/java-nand-gate.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd java-nand-gate`
3. Build the project using Maven: `mvn clean install`
4. Run the tests: `mvn test`

Feel free to explore the code, add new features, or modify existing components for a deeper understanding of digital logic simulation.
